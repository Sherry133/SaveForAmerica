                <img src="../../images/skiing-family.jpg"
                    alt="skiing family">

            <div class="article-content">


                <p>From birth, we are a voracious learning center full
                    of
                    curiosity. By
                    age
                    4 or 5 our brain has quadrupled in size. (Goswami
                    2008)
                    Yet, the
                    ability
                    for us to learn as we grow is dependent upon our
                    cognitive
                    development.
                    Just as children need to walk before they run, they
                    also
                    need
                    personal,
                    enjoyable experiences with money, like shopping with
                    their parents,
                    to
                    prepare them to understand basic financial concepts
                    like
                    counting
                    money,
                    a skill not typically acquired until age 5.</p>

                <h3>Discovery Learning Reigns!</h3>
                <p>Early on, we learn by imitating the actions of our
                    parents. From then
                    on, it’s all about discovery learning. Providing
                    children with
                    abundant
                    experiences within a trusted learning environment
                    prepares them to
                    tackle new problems with confidence and try
                    different
                    strategies to
                    solve their problems. (e.g. Chen & Siegler, 2000)
                    This
                    ability,
                    known as
                    metacognition, is valuable in resolving financial
                    dilemmas or better
                    yet, avoiding them later in life.</p>

                <P>‘You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him
                    drink,’ is
                    another
                    way of saying learning is more effective if we’re
                    motivated.
                    Children
                    need to understand the relevancy of a proposed
                    activity
                    to their
                    life or
                    they may rebel feeling it’s not worthwhile.
                    Explaining
                    the
                    relationship
                    between the activity and their situation will also
                    give
                    them
                    confidence
                    they can succeed at a task–at their appropriate
                    cognitive level. For
                    example, you wouldn’t ask a 5 year-old to make
                    change.
                    (Gelman and
                    Merk,
                    1986)</P>

                <h3>Cultivate A Strong Relationship</h3>

                <p>Finally, a parent’s relationship with their young
                    child
                    strongly
                    influences the child’s cognitive ability. Reading to
                    your child,
                    language development activities, responsiveness and
                    warmth of
                    interactions influence positive growth and
                    development
                    as well as
                    the
                    motivation to learn. (eg. Grolnick, 2009; Melhush,
                    2010)
                </p>

                <h3>Learning Behaviors Indicate Readiness</h3>
                <p>As we explore ‘saving’, we will often refer to the
                    extent
                    to which
                    the
                    following cognitive learning behaviors are necessary
                    and
                    relevant to
                    the
                    skill to be acquired. i.e. receiving an allowance.
                    To
                    have a
                    positive
                    learning experience, we will discuss the necessity
                    for a
                    child:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To exhibit self-control</li>
                    <li>To plan for future events</li>
                    <li>To be attentive</li>
                    <li>To remember instructions</li>
                    <li>To apply learned concepts</li>
                    <li>To perceive causal relationships</li>
                    <li>To comprehend that skills learned today will be
                        of
                        future benefit</li>
