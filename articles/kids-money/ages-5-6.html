            <h1>Kids & Money: Ages 5-6</h1>

            <div class="article-content">
                <!-- Your article content here -->
                <p>The little ones are now in Kindergarten or first
                    grade.
                    Their awareness
                    of money and its benefits is heightened and now it's
                    personal. Today's
                    schools are asking them to help pay for their
                    education
                    by contacting
                    their relatives to ask for money. This money may be
                    an
                    outright donation
                    to fund the librarian or computer lab or it could be
                    a
                    request to
                    purchase wrapping paper, cookie dough or grapefruit!
                </p>
                <h3>Experience Counts!</h3>

                <p>They may be thinking they won’t have any books to
                    read if there’s no
                    librarian—and they like reading! Time to panic? Well
                    no, because this is
                    where their ‘hidden’ inclination to exhibit
                    self-control surfaces.
                    Together with their parents they create a plan to
                    induce their aunts,
                    uncles and grandparents to help fund the librarian!
                    At this age, budding
                    self-control tendencies and the ability to plan
                    future events for
                    personal benefit are inherent readiness skills!</p>

                <p> Interesting to them is that this librarian scarcity
                    dilemma can simply
                    be rectified with money. This is the first step to
                    understanding that
                    money has VALUE. Comparing the monetary value of a
                    librarian versus a
                    computer is, however, not possible at this age! In
                    addition, their
                    attention span for discussions of such abstract
                    topics is way too short.</p>
                <h3>Money is a Tool</h3>
                <div class="image-bubble">
                    <img src="../../images/boy-skateboard.jpg"
                        alt="Boy on skateboard">
                </div>
                <p>At this age, children are beginning to understand
                    that money is a tool
                    that can be used to achieve goals. They may not yet
                    grasp the full
                    concept of budgeting or saving, but they can start
                    to
                    see how money can
                    help them get what they want, like toys or treats.
                </p>
                <h3>Money is Interesting</h3>

                <p>What CAN be gleaned by 5-6 year olds, is that money
                    has
                    an important
                    place in the lives of their family members and now
                    in
                    their own life.
                    They will be involved in discussions about
                    fund-raising
                    goals that have
                    been set for their family to help pay for their
                    school
                    librarian. This
                    will definitely motivate them to learn more about
                    money.
                    Here are some
                    money activities you can do with your children to
                    reinforce basic money
                    concepts.</p>

                <h3>Funny Money</h3>

                <p>>Go on a treasure hunt for misplaced coins around the
                    house—on the floor,
                    under pillows, in jars and pockets etc. When found,
                    arrange all the
                    coins in their specific piles and ask your child to
                    count them by the
                    number in the stack. Next, show them how a nickel is
                    five pennies etc.
                    Ask them if they would rather have a nickel or a
                    penny.
                    Don’t expect
                    them to understand the value of the various coins,
                    but
                    you have piqued
                    their imagination. Now, take them shopping with you
                    and
                    show them how to
                    put coins together to check out. Buy a McDonald’s
                    special $.50 soft
                    serve on the way home with coins found around the
                    house.</p>

                <h3>Money Money Money!</h3>

                <p>Play Clue Jr. or Checkers with them . These games
                    reinforce ‘planning’
                    and ‘thinking’ skills that can help them understand
                    abstract ‘coin
                    value’ concepts.

                    Use cooking as a way to teach coin concepts to your
                    children. Help them
                    cut a lime in half and then show them that one
                    nickel is
                    half of a dime.

                    Buy Cuisenaire rods and teach them fractions! Amazon
                    has
                    inexpensive sets. I used them to teach my children
                    basic math
                    concepts.</p>
                <p>Play Monopoly Junior with them. This game is a
                    great way to introduce
                    the concept of money management and decision-making.
                    They can learn
                    about buying properties, collecting rent, and making
                    choices about how
                    to spend their money.</p>
                <p>Remember, at this age, the goal is to make learning
                    about money fun and
                    engaging. Use simple language, relatable examples,
                    and interactive
                    activities to help them grasp the basic concepts of
                    money management.
                    As they grow older, you can build on these
                    foundations
                    to teach them
                    more complex financial skills.</p>
