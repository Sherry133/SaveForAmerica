                <h3>Kids and Money ages 4-5</h3>
                <p>This is the first in a new series of
                    articles designed to
                    help you teach your children about money including
                    its value, its
                    management and how to invest it for maximum returns.
                    Woven through all
                    these fundamental concepts will be financial
                    responsibility without
                    which financial literacy is worthless. With college
                    and credit card debt
                    in the TRILLIONS, we must ensure even our youngest
                    children acquire the
                    financial literacy they need for a secure and happy
                    future.</p>
                <h3>It's not Easy...</h3>
                <div class="image-bubble-1 float-right">

                </div>

                <p>We begin the series with tips and tricks for engaging
                    your 4-5 year-olds
                    in the money game. At this tender age, most of them
                    are just learning to
                    count and are not capable of understanding how the
                    value of money
                    relates to purchases and employment. You may want to
                    refer to an earlier
                    article on How Learning Influences Saving at this
                    website for more
                    information.</p>

                <h3>Engagement</h3>

                <p>Walking the dog is expensive if you have to hire a
                    'dog
                    walker'.
                    Offering to pay your children to walk the dog at
                    this
                    age is pointless
                    because they cannot understand the value of money
                    yet.
                    They can,
                    however, understand the concept that paying a 'dog
                    walker' for a month
                    means we can't go out for pizza and a movie every
                    Friday
                    night. It's one
                    or the other! Walking the dog can quickly become the
                    lead-in to a
                    discussion on where money comes from and how to get
                    it!</p>

                <h3>Bartering--it works!</h3>

                <p>While young children don't yet understand the value
                    of
                    money, they seem
                    quite adroit at bartering! They know what they like
                    and
                    they want
                    it--NOW! You can use this natural instinct to your
                    advantage in helping
                    them understand that money doesn't just pop up out
                    of
                    the ground like a
                    weed. And speaking of weeds, children this age are
                    entirely capable of
                    pulling weeds. And guess what, a nickel for every 10
                    weeds they pull can
                    add up to a trip to the ice cream parlor pretty
                    fast.
                    And by the way,
                    this is how mommy and daddy get money--we work for
                    it,
                    too!</p>
                <p>I fully support parents who limit their
                    children's
                    screen time. Enough
                    of coming home from kindergarten to sit and watch TV
                    or
                    play with an
                    iPad even if it is educational. But, if you limit
                    screen
                    time more than
                    normal, you can introduce the concept of BONUS
                    screen
                    time for extra
                    time spent outside or in physical activity/sports!
                    Bonus
                    time can lead
                    to discussions of how you earn bonuses at work and
                    try
                    to save that
                    extra money for emergencies. By the way, I don't
                    think
                    it's prudent to
                    discuss traumatic financial affairs in front of
                    children. There's
                    nothing a 5-year old can do about your financial
                    problems, but they
                    still are old enough to worry about your welfare
                    instead
                    of
                    concentrating on success in school.</p>

                <h3>More Engagement...</h3>

                <p>Everyone is short on time, but no one more that
                    MOTHERS. Increasing your child's financial literacy
                    works best when you involve them in your daily
                    financial management tasks, where possible. For
                    example, when you're making up your shopping list,
                    ask you children for input. Not only might it be an
                    insight into the commercials they are
                    watching/hearing, but it gives you the opportunity
                    to talk about your food budget! No, we don't just go
                    to the store and buy anything and everything we see
                    on the shelves.</p>

                </p>

                <h3>Rewards</h3>

                <p>A girl's night out with mom can be the best
                    reward
                    of all for sticking
                    to your budget! Share your food budget with your
                    child and take her
                    shopping with you. Keep your receipts and at the
                    end
                    of the month, total
                    them together to see if your stayed within your
                    budget. If you did, plan
                    a special event to celebrate your thrift. Saving
                    and
                    being thrifty
                    should be a celebrated endeavor whenever
                    possible!</p>
