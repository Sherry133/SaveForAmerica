                    <p> At this
                        age, children are becoming more aware of money
                        and
                        its uses. They may start to receive an allowance
                        or
                        earn money through chores or small jobs. This is
                        a
                        great time to introduce concepts like saving,
                        spending wisely, and the value of money.</p>
                    <p>Here are some tips for parents and caregivers:
                    </p>

                            "Save," "Spend," and "Share."
                            When your child receives money (allowance,
                            gifts), guide them to
                            allocate a percentage to each jar.
                            Enhancement: Discuss the goals for each jar.
                            What are they saving for?
                            What do they want to spend on? Which charity
                            or cause do they want to
                            support with their "Share" money?</li>

                            store, discuss each item: Is it a need or a
                            want? How does it fit into
                            the budget?
                            Enhancement: Let your child help compare
                            prices and choose the most
