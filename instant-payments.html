                <h3>What is FedNow?</h3>

                <div class="image-bubble-1 float-right">
                    <img src="images/family-park.jpg" alt="Beach Scene">
                </div>
                <p>FedNow is a new instant payment infrastructure
                    developed by the
                    Federal Reserve. It enables financial institutions
                    of all sizes
                    across the U.S. to offer real-time, 24/7/365 instant
                    payment
                    services to their customers—both individuals and
                    businesses. With
                    FedNow, funds are transferred and made available to
                    recipients
                    within seconds, providing immediate access and
                    flexibility for
                    time-sensitive transactions.</p>

                <h3>Who Can Provide FedNow Services?</h3>
                <p><strong>Eligible Providers:</strong> Banks and credit
                    unions that
                    participate in the FedNow Service can offer instant
                    payment
                    capabilities to their customers. These institutions
                    may connect
                    directly or work with certified service providers
                    like idebit to
                    implement and
                    manage instant payments.</p>
                <p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> In addition to
                    financial
                    institutions, certified service providers—like
                    idebit—play a key role in
                    supporting banks
                    and credit unions with FedNow implementation and
                    ongoing operations.
                </p>

                <h3>Benefits to Consumers</h3>
                <div class="image-bubble">
                    <img src="images/friendly-family.jpg"
                        alt="Friendly family">
                </div>
                <p><strong>Real-Time Access:</strong> Consumers can send
                    and receive
                    money instantly, ensuring immediate access to funds
                    for urgent needs
                    such as payroll, bill payments, or emergency
                    expenses.</p>
                <p><strong>24/7/365 Availability:</strong> Payments can
                    be made any
                    time—nights, weekends, and holidays
                    included—eliminating delays
                    associated with traditional banking hours or
                    processing windows.</p>
                <p><strong>Financial Flexibility:</strong> Instant
                    payments help avoid
                    late fees, support just-in-time bill payments, and
                    provide greater
                    control over personal finances.</p>
                <p><strong>Immediate Confirmation:</strong> Both senders
                    and recipients
                    receive instant confirmation that a payment has been
                    completed,
                    increasing transparency and trust in transactions.
                </p>

                <h3>What Does “Instant Payment” Mean?</h3>
                <p>An instant payment is a transaction where funds are
                    transferred and
                    settled between accounts in real time, typically
                    within 20 seconds
                    or less. This means the recipient has immediate
                    access to the money,
                    unlike traditional transfers that may take hours or
                    days to process.
                    Instant payments are available around the clock,
                    providing unmatched
                    speed and convenience for both personal and business
                    transactions.
                </p>
